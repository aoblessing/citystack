# CityStack: Decentralized Urban Planning Platform

## Project Overview
CityStack is a revolutionary decentralized urban planning platform built on the Stacks blockchain that enables community-driven city development through transparent resource allocation and democratic decision-making.

### üåÜ Vision
To transform urban development by creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where property owners can directly participate in and influence local development decisions through a secure, transparent, and efficient blockchain-based voting system.

### üéØ Key Features
- **Property-Based Voting Rights**: Voting power calculated based on verified property ownership and location
- **Smart Resource Allocation**: Automated distribution of development resources based on community consensus
- **Transparent Proposal System**: Community members can create and vote on development proposals
- **Location-Based Governance**: Geographically-weighted voting system for localized decision making
- **Real-time Resource Tracking**: Monitor allocation and usage of community resources
- **Integrated Bitcoin Security**: Leverage Bitcoin's security for immutable decision records

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
1. `property-registry.clar`
   - Property verification and registration
   - Voting power calculation
   - Location-based weighting system

2. `proposal-manager.clar`
   - Proposal creation and management
   - Voting mechanisms
   - Result execution

3. `resource-allocator.clar`
   - Resource distribution logic
   - Budget management
   - Execution tracking

4. `governance-token.clar`
   - DAO governance token
   - Staking mechanisms
   - Reward distribution

### üí° Unique Value Propositions
- First urban planning DAO built on Stacks
- Bitcoin-backed security for development decisions
- Integration with real property ownership records
- Automated resource allocation based on community consensus
- Location-aware voting weight calculation
